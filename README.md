# School District Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to categorize the schools dataset to draw meaningful connections between school type, size, academic performance, and budget. These conclusions will help in the allocation of funds and overall understanding of socioeconomic factors and there effects on education. In this exercise, there was an instance of academic dishonesty among the ninth grade students at Thomas High School. We were tasked with removing their data entries from the analysis.
